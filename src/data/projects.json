I initially began this project as a small python script that would take in midi files and generate rudimentary melodies, but only later did I have the inspiration to turn it into a full fledged project. I wrapped the script in a Flask backend, and created a RESTful API along with a React frontend, and the project is now hosted on Heroku.",

The website solves this problem by showing a list of all the academic buildings on campus, and displays whether there is a class or an ongoing reservation currently taking place in it or not, and allows the user to reserve it themselves if it is free. This was a group project for a database class, and I primarily focused on the development of the frontend and the design of the database schema, as I am not familiar with Elixir.",
